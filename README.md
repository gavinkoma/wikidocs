Two rats have ademas again, both will need drained. Rats 524/525 will need to be drained today. Unsure if these are the same rats that developed ademas on Friday (July 22). Will have to check with George.

Same two rats have ademas again, both might need drained but they are notably smaller than they were yesterday. --> check with george
8 rats need to be recorded today, may need to do half today and other half tomorrow.
